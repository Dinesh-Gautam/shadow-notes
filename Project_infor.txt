Use React routers   ()
improve auth code   *

use useReducer() hook for storing input values
every input will have a different id and will be stored in state (using useReducer() hook)
and there will be another state to manage all inputs which are displayed


old approach------------
added another state to manage input values *
now set values of input to new state using id *
now change value updater *
then change remove element *
then figure out list input #

new approach------------
using use reducer this time *

formSubmit handler *
